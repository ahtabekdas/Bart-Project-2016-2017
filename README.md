# Bart-Project-2016-2017
This project focuses on addressing key data analytics questions related to the San Francisco BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) project from 2016-2017.

We will seek answers to the following questions:
 - Which BART station is the busiest?
 - What is the least popular BART route?
 - When is the best time to go from Berkeley to SF if you want to find a seat?
 - Which day of the week is the busiest?
 - How many people take the BART late at night?

For data science questions:
  - Question A: Compute the straight-line distance between every station.
  - Question B: Build a model to predict the number of people commuting between any 2 stations.
