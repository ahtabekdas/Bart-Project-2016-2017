# Bart-Project-2016-2017
This project focuses on addressing key data analytics questions related to the San Francisco BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) project from 2016-2017.

We will seek answers to the following questions:
 1- Which BART station is the busiest?
 2- What is the least popular BART route?
 3- When is the best time to go from Berkeley to SF if you want to find a seat?
 4- Which day of the week is the busiest?
 5- How many people take the BART late at night?

For data science questions:
  Question A: Compute the straight-line distance between every station.
  Question B: Build a model to predict the number of people commuting between any 2 stations.
